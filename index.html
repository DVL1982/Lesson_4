          To talk of the 1987 Buick GNX one has to first go back to 1982 with
          the launch of the Buick Regal Grand National. It was, after all the
          Grand National that quickly boosted Buick’s reputation for providing
          performance-oriented turbo-charged cars. The Grand National also
          brought Buick the Manufacturer’s Trophy in the 1981 NASCAR Winston Cup
          Grand National Series. The GNX was introduced in 1987 as a
          limited-edition, higher-performance edition of the Buick Grand
          National. Buick produced 547 GNX models in 1987, a small number
          compared to the 20,193 Grand Nationals produced that same year. The
          GNX was produced in cooperation with McLaren Engines and ASC
          Incorporated.

          The GNX featured modifications of the turbo-charged and intercooled
          <mark id="important"

            wheels and tires, suspension and exhaust system modifications,
            analog instrument cluster and functional body modifications</mark
          >. The GNX was the quickest American car you could buy in 1987. It
          recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7 seconds. The GNX was the ultimate
          expression of the T-Types.

          T-Type cars were built as performance-oriented versions of popular
          Buick models. The first Buick to receive the T-Type designation was
          the 1981 Rivera. Buick extended the T-Type package across several
          nameplates, including Skyhawk, Century, Regal, LaSabre, Electra and
          Riviera. The interiors of T-Type cars differed from most other Buicks
          in that the front seats were almost always bucket seats, and the
          shifter was mounted in the center console, except the 1981-85 Rivieras
          which had the buckets and a consolette but a column shifter. The
          “T-Top” roof was another noteworthy feature of T-Type models. The
          T-Type logo consisted of a large red letter “T”, and the word “Type”
          in small black or white letters. The emblems were only placed on the
          fenders and on some later models (1986) a grille emblem was used.

          While the T-Type designation slowly faded by 1990, Buick’s commitment
          to turbo-charged performance cars did not. The 2015 Regal luxury
          performance car comes equipped with a 259-hp turbocharged engine mated
          to a 6 speed transmission, either automatic or manual. Available
          All-Wheel Drive offers sure-footed control so you can thoroughly enjoy
          every twist and turn of the road. And drivers can switch between three
          exciting driving modes with Interactive Drive Control. The Regal GS
          offers classic design details like chrome accents and dual
          stainless-steel exhaust tips add a confident flair, while the newly
          designed headlamps and tail lamps leave a lasting impression, coming
          and going. And the “T” designation on turbo-charged models is a
          well-deserved nod to the high-performance predecessors of past Regals.
